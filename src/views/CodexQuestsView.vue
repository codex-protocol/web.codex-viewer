    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Codex Quests are designed to provide opportunities for our community to receive CODX tokens in reward for completing specific tasks related to Codex Viewer on a given day.
        On each quest day, the team will be around on social media to listen to your feedback so that we can incorporate your ideas into building a better product.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more details on how to participate and claim your CODX rewards, <a href="https://medium.com/@johnhforrest/announcing-codex-quests-our-bug-bounty-program-b034678014b3" target="_blank">check out the original announcement on Medium</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The schedule of the quests is as follows:</p>

      <div class="schedule">
        <h2>June 26th - Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          Share the "Full Assembly" edition you claimed from your collection on Twitter and tag Codex Protocol (be sure to make your Codex Record public before sharing!).
        </p>

        <h2>June 29th - Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Tweet us your Rinkeby ETH address to receive a Codex Record from the team. Accept this transfer on the incoming transfers tab.
        </p>

        <h2>July 3rd - Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          Add a "behind the scenes" picture (e.g. a picture of your monitor displaying the artwork) to the "Full Assembly" edition you've claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, click the "Manage" button on the details page of the your edition of "Full Assembly". (This button will only show up for Codex Records you own.)
        </p>
        <p><img src="../assets/images/codex-quests/modifications-1.png"></p>
        <p>
          After clicking the "Manage" button, a modal dialog will pop up that allows you to edit metadata and attach additional photos.
        </p>
        <p><img src="../assets/images/codex-quests/modifications-2.png"></p>
        <p>
          After adding your “behind the scenes” photo, click on “Save” to submit the updates to the blockchain and send a link to your updated Codex Record to codex-quests@codexprotocol.com.
        </p>

        <h2>July 9th - Tokens</h2>
        <p>
          Grab some CODX from the faucet so that you are prepared for when protocol fees are turned on later this week.
          After you have some tokens, send a screenshot of your non-zero balance to codex-quests@codexprotocol.com as evidence of you completing the quest.
        </p>

        <h2>July 11th - Gallery</h2>
        <p><b>Fees for the registry will now be turned on, so make sure you have CODX from the faucet!</b><p>

        <p>
          Create a Codex Record (receive a bonus of $5 in CODX for sharing your own artwork) and transfer it to address <a href="https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x61E69543d7858AFE535241A6e1DdD22A11ae47B4" target="_blank">0x61E69543d7858AFE535241A6e1DdD22A11ae47B4</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Address 0x61E69543d7858AFE535241A6e1DdD22A11ae47B4 is going to be our first Codex Gallery. Any Codex Records owned by this account will be made public, and shared at <b-link to="/gallery">The Codex Gallery</b-link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that by the end of our Beta period, we'll have a unique gallery composed of all the artists &amp; collectors in our community.
