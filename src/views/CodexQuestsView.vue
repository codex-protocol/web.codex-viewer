      <p>
        Codex Quests are designed to provide opportunities for our community to receive CODX tokens in reward for completing specific tasks related to Codex Viewer on a given day.
        On each quest day, the team will be around on social media to listen to your feedback so that we can incorporate your ideas into building a better product.
      </p>

      <!-- @TODO: replace with real link -->
      <p>
        For more details on how to participate and claim your CODX rewards, <a href="#" target="_blank">check out the original announcement on Medium</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The schedule of the quests is as follows:</p>

      <div class="schedule">
        <h2>June 25th - Contest</h2>
        <p>
          Share the "Digital Assembly" edition you claimed from your collection on social media for a chance to win CODX at our Token Generation Event (be sure to make your Codex Record public before sharing!).
        </p>

        <h2>June 27th - Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Tweet us your Rinkeby ETH address to receive a Codex Record from the team. Accept this transfer on the incoming transfers tab.
        </p>

        <h2>July 2nd - Modifications</h2>
        <p>
          Add a "behind the scenes" picture to the Digital Assembly edition you've claimed. For example, take a picture of your monitor displaying the Codex Record.
        </p>

        <h2>July 4th</h2>
        <p>Skipping for the holiday</p>

        <h2>July 9th - Tokens</h2>
        <p>
          Grab some CODX from the faucet and stake some tokens to receive a discount on any protocol operations after fees are turned on later this week.
        </p>

        <h2>July 11th - Gallery</h2>
        <p><b>Fees for the registry will now be turned on, so make sure you have CODX from the faucet!</b><p>

        <!-- @TODO: Update ETH address to the actual one -->
        <p>Create a Codex Record (bonus points for drawing your own!) and transfer it to address XXX.</p>
        <p>
          Address XXX is going to be our first Codex Gallery. Any Codex Records owned by this account will be made public, and shared at <b-link to="/gallery">The Codex Gallery</b-link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that by the end of our Beta period, we'll have a unique gallery composed of all the artists &amp; collectors in our community.
